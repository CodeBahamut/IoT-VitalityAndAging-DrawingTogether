# VitalityAndAging - Drawing Together

Studies have shown that it is important for elderly people to keep their creative brain activated. But for some elderly people it is harder to participate in creative activities. And that is why we are designing the Drawbot.

The Drawbot is a robot that can draw together with people. It reacts on what someone has drawn and uses unique movement to make wonderful art. This way elderly people will be able to use their creative brain and improve their cognitive skills without them spending hours having to physically draw.

Current Project Goals For this project we are going to do a lot of research on the technical options and availabilities of the Jetbot. After the research we want to have a Drawbot with the following end goals:

For those who just want to browse through the repository look below. 

## Jetbot
Our Drawbot is based on the [Jetbot](https://jetbot.org/master/), we used the body of the Jetbot and modified to our needs by including a penholder that can lift and lower the pen using a servo. We also added an extension to the camera holder to accommodate the changes. We also added a base plate at the bottom to hold the Wemos D1 Mini which is controlling the servo and of course the servo itself.

As for the bill of materials you can follow this [link](./docs/bill_of_materials.md).

## Build/Assembly guide

To find out how to build the Drawbot go to the [product manual](./docs/product_manual.md). There you will instructed on the adjustments you need to make to the [Jetbot](https://jetbot.org/master/). Of course you first need the [Jetbot](https://jetbot.org/master/) to be able to follow this guide.
