# Connect with the Drawbot

## Accessing the server through the hotspot
To access and set up the Drawbot to be used, a server is created. This server boots when the drawbot is turned on. The server is published by the Drawbot and can be accessed connecting to the Wi-Fi Hotspot: 
```
SSID: Drawbot
Pass: drawbot123
```

Once connected, you can either go to the [Drawbot Control Center](http://jetbot.local:5000) or the [Jupyter Notebook environment](http://jetbot.local:8888)
