# Definition of Done
The Definition of Done is an agreed-upon set of items that must be completed before a project or user story can be considered complete. It is applied consistently and serves as an official gate separating things from being “in progress” to “done.”

1. Code is deployed to the develop branch.
2. Code is peer-reviewed.
3. Documentation is updated.
