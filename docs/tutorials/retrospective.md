## How the retrospective goes down

Team gets together (preferrably in person). This will be done at the end of every sprint. Here the team discusses:

1. **What went well**  
We take 5 minutes to write down things that went well. Each item gets written on a sticky note. The notes will be placed on a board. After five minutes, the team removes duplicates and discusses the notes.

2. **What they would want to change**  
Next five minutes, the team writes down some more points on things they'd like to change (also 1 per note). When the time is up, duplicates are removed and action points are discussed.

3. **What actions they will take to improve future sprints**  
The team now has knowlegde on the scrum process from all team members. They will discuss and figure out what changes they want to make in the next sprint. These changes consist of SMART goals and are described in the sprint retrospective report
