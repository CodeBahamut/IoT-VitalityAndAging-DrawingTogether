# What cameras are available for the Jetbot?

The current camera with the Jetbot is the Raspberry pi camera V2. We have experienced that the camera is having difficulties detecting colors due to change of lightning throughout the day. Hence why we are researching the available camera options for the Jetbot.

After researching the available camera options for the Jetson our best option would be the [16MP IMX519](https://thepihut.com/products/arducam-imx519-autofocus-camera-module-for-raspberry-pi). This camera is a noticeable upgrade from the [Raspberry Pi v2](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/sensors/optical/cameras-and-scanners/raspberry-pi-camera-v2-8mp) and because of the price this would be the most logical upgrade. The [12MP IMX477 ](https://www.sossolutions.nl/arducam-12mp-imx477-mini-high-quality-camera-module-for-raspberry-pi) would be the best available option if you want the highest quality but in my opinion that would be overkill in our project. Because the camera is pretty expensive and we don't need the option to switch out multiple lenses. All we need is a good quality camera that can detect lines, shapes and colors. Below you'll find a screenshot comparing the 3 different cameras.
