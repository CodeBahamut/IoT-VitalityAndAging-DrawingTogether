# Debriefing Project

**Vitality and aging drawing together**
 
Studies have shown that it is important for elderly people to keep their creative brain activated. But for some elderly people it is harder to participate in creative activities. And that is why we are designing the Drawbot.
 
The Drawbot is a robot that can draw together with people. It reacts on what someone has drawn and uses unique movement to make wonderful art. This way elderly people will be able to use their creative brain and improve their cognitive skills without them spending hours having to physically draw.
 
Current Project Goals
For this project we are going to do a lot of research on the technical options and availabilities of the Jetbot. After the research we want to have a Drawbot with the following end goals:
 
1.            Recognizing colours and lines
2.            Operating the robot based on recognized colours and lines
3.            Making it possible to interact with the Drawbot
 
Sprint 1 goals
1.            Creating a pen holder for the Jetbot so that it can draw something
2.            Using the Jetbot to recognize the color: red, making the Drawbot turn 180 degrees
